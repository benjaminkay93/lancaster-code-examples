## Questions in the Lecture

We were asked in the lecture about the impact that React and React Native will have going forward in web development. Josh gave an answer around React Native and I (Ben) went into depth a little bit on React and how that is reframing how we should look at Web Development Going forward. I briefly mentioned about how we should now be looking at Client Side and Server Side rendering of pages, which leads to a Single Page App world (Known colloquially as SPA).

[Here is an overview of Single Page Apps I read and enjoyed.](https://flaviocopes.com/single-page-application/)
